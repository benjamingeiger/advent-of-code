This one I did via Wolfram Alpha mainly because I was too lazy to do the algebra.

Let the race time be t and the delay in launch be d. Then the total distance (x)
is equal to:

x = (t - d) * d

So, the solution to part 1 is to determine how many delays d lead to a
greater distance than the record (r).

This can be done by calculating the zero crossings of ((t - d) * d) - r. Round
the lower crossing up and the higher crossing down. (When the zero crossing is
an integer, note that ties aren't successes, so add or subtract as needed.)
