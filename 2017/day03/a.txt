Solved by hand.

Input is 312051. The largest square smaller than the input is 558^2, or 311364.

Perfect squares are found at the top left corners of completed squares. (Odd
squares are found at the bottom rights of those squares.)

This leaves 687 units between the top left corner of the completed square and
the target square. If we go 559 units, we end up at the bottom left corner of
the next square, with 128 units left to go.

From the initial square to the bottom left corner has a Manhattan distance of
558 steps. But, the target square is 128 units closer, so we can subtract those
128 units from the 558 unit distance, giving a distance of 430.
